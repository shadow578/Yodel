# Forks

Forks are allowed so long they abide by [Yodel's LICENSE](LICENSE)

When creating a fork, remember to:

- Avoid confusion with the main app by:
  - Changing the app name (strings/app_name)
  - Changing the app icon
- Avoid installation conflicts by:
  - Change the 'applicationId' in build.gradle



# Code Style Guidelines

These are the guidelines you should follow when contributing code to Yodel.<br>
These Guidelines outline what I think are useful rules to create readable and manageable code, tho they are always open for discussion(i'm not a professional developer after all, so what do i know :P)


- Yodel uses the [Model View ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) pattern
- Use Kotlin as the main development language
  - I'm new to kotlin, so if i'm doing something stupid (or could do it better), please let me know
  - if you use a language concept that is not obvious, please leave a comment
- Do not hardcode stuff (intent extras/actions, urls, ...), but use constants in the appropriate classes instead
- Enums in PascalCase (convention seems to be ALL_UPPERCASE, but that looks ridiculous)
- include kdoc comments for:
  - __all__ classes, interfaces and enums
  - __all__ public fields, methods and constants
  - _optionally_ private fields, methods and constants
  - comments should describe the class/field/method, but don't have to be too long
- do __not__ ignore lint warnings
- Try to include tests for your contribution (where applicable)
  - Yodel uses [Kotest](https://kotest.io/) with JUnit for unit and instrumented tests
